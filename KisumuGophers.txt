Their cons and pros in development

capacity and length operations; and their significance...everything a coder should know about them
....thier relationship
//how to make changes on a parent slice/array without changing the backing/underlying array

//making anoriginalbacking array then using makemethod to create another slice(childofbacking slice)...
